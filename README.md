## Contributing
Style guide: [idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js), Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).

_Also, please **don't** edit files in the **"dist"** or **"/public/javascript/"** subdirectories as they are generated via grunt. You'll find source code in the "lib" subdirectory!_
